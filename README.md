Structures and solutions for JS algorithm problems

# Algoritms
## BFS
JS implementation
2 Leetcode problems solved
### Problems
- **Flood fill problem** (solved): Paint problem. Given an image represented by a matrix, paint a pixel (src) and all the neightbours of the same color.
- **Shortes path maze** (solved): Find the shortest of all the paths from the origin (0, 0) position to the exit (n -1, n-1) in a squared matrix

## DFS
JS implementation.
4 Leetcode problems solved
### Problems
- **Min tree node difference** (solved): Find the minimum arithmetic difference between any two numbers in a seaerch tree
- **Recover binary tree** (solved): Recover search tree property using DFS
- **Redundant Connection** (solved): Find a cycle in a graph and the last edge that forms part of it 
- **Maximum path sum in binary tree** (solved): Find the path (going through parent-child edges) between 2 nodes that sum the highest.
- **Escape the maze**: In a infinity mae where are some blocked squares, try to connect the origin with the target.

# Data structures
## Linked lists
1 Leetcode problem solved
- **Next greater node in linked list** (solved): For every node in a linked list, return the next node higher
- **Linked list inside binary tree** (solved): Given a binary tree (not necessary balanced nor sorted), find if there is a path from up to down that matches a given linked list.
