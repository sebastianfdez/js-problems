Structures and solutions for JS algorithm problems

# BFS
JS implementation and solved Leetcode problems
## Problems
- **Flood fill problem** (solved): Paint problem. Given an image represented by a matrix, paint a pixel (src) and all the neightbours of the same color.
- **Shortes path maze** (solved): Find the shortest of all the paths from the origin (0, 0) position to the exit (n -1, n-1) in a squared matrix

# DFS
JS implementation.
3 solved problems
## Problems
- **Min tree node difference** (solved): Find the minimum arithmetic difference between any two numbers in a seaerch tree
- **Recover binary tree** (solved): Recover search tree property using DFS
- **Redundant-connection** (solved): Find a cycle in a graph and the last edge that forms part of it 
- **Escape the maze**: In a infinity mae where are some blocked squares, try to connect the origin with the target.
